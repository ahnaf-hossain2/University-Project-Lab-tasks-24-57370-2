## 📝 NOTES FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### Important Files to Know
- `SessionManager.cs` - Must be used for all user context
- `DatabaseHelper.cs` - All data operations go through here
- `Homepage.cs` - Entry point and authentication hub

### Common Tasks
**To add new feature:**
1. Add database method to DatabaseHelper
2. Create form or modify existing
3. Call database method from form
4. Add validation before calling
5. Provide user feedback after operation
6. Use SessionManager for user context

**To modify existing feature:**
1. Find the form handling it
2. Locate the event handler method
3. Update logic or validation
4. Test changes
5. Verify database operations still work

### Debugging Tips
- Enable SQL error logging: Add Console.WriteLine in DatabaseHelper catch blocks
- Check SessionManager.CurrentUser before using it
- Verify control names match exactly in Designer
- Test database connection first: DatabaseHelper.VerifyConnection()

### Known Limitations
1. No pagination (all data loaded at once)
2. No async operations (UI may freeze with large datasets)
3. MessageBox for results (consider DataGridView)
4. Plain text passwords (upgrade to hashing)
5. No audit logging
6. No backup/restore functionality
